<center><h1>About Me</h1></center>
	<p>Hello My name is Jeter Oviedo Arevalo.  I am a senior at Thomas A. Edison Technical Highschool.  I have 3 years of coding thanks to my Web and App development shop class that I took in sophmore, junior, and senior year.  With the knowledge I got from this shop class I have been able to code lots of websites, programs, and games.  I've also been able to land 3 internships with this knowledge of programming and was able to give back and help people with there program/website.  I wish to persue this field of code in the future.</p>
